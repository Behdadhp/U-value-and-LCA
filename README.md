# Website

This website is going to be created for calculating the U value and LCA(Life Cycle Assessment).
The initial idea is to receive a JSON and read the data in order to calculate
and give the result in a PDF format.
Data is created by a plugin which is deployed in Revit and it converts the 3D model to 
a JSON. <br />
This website belongs to a Master Thesis in civil engineering.
